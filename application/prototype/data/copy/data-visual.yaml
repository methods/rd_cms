        title: What ‘unemployment’ is
        copy: 
          - The rate of UK unemployment as a percentage of the potential labour force.
          - Unemployed people are those without a job who have been actively seeking work in the past 4 weeks and are available to start work in the next 2 weeks. It also includes those who are out of work but have found a job and are waiting to start it in the next 2 weeks. Find out more about how unemployment is measured.
          - The level and rate of UK unemployment are measured by the Labour Force Survey (LFS) using a definition of unemployment specified by the International Labour Organisation.

            content: Changes were made to the Labour Force Survey ethnicity questions in January to March 2011 to bring them more in line with Census data collection on these topics. In April to June 2011 furthers changes were made to the ethnicity questions to bring them in line with Scottish Census. As a result there may be some inconsistencies with estimates prior to 2011.

    title: Main points
    copy: 
      - In the UK, 4.6% of the total population, aged 16+, were unemployed between October and December, 2016 - which is around 1.5 million people.
      - The rate of unemployment in the UK has been falling for all ethnic groups and is currently at it lowest level.
      - Bangladeshi people had the highest rates (14.3%) of unemployment between October and December 2016 - around 30,000 people.
      - Bangladeshi people were nearly 3.5 times more likely to be unemployed compared to White people.
      - Chinese people had the lowest rates (3.5%) of unemployment - around 6,000 people.
      - The youngest age groups (16-24) have the highest unemployment rates compared to other age groups.
      - Females have higher unemployement rates than men.

    title: Things you need to know
    copy: 
      - These unemployment figures are estimates based on a national survey and therefore are subject to sampling error and in some cases may not reflect the actual population.
      - Smaller numbers of survey respondents from ethnic minority backgrounds mean that unemployment estimates for ethnic minorities are more unreliable than estimates for White people.
      - Results derived from a low number of responses are more likely to be affected by statistical variation, so observed changes might not reflect real differences. As such, caution is needed when interpreting short-term trends in the data especially for sub groups (for example, a particular ethnic group, age group and gender). Any values based on fewer than five responses have been completely suppressed. Values based on 5-10 responses are shown, but marked by an asterisk (*). These should be used with particular caution.
      - Estimates for unemployement rates by ethnicity by age by gender are given as annual estimates rather than quarterly estimates as sample sizes are not large enough to give reliable quarterly estimates.

In April to June 2011 furthers changes were made to the ethnicity questions to bring them in line with Scottish Census. As a result there may be some inconsistencies with estimates prior to 2011.

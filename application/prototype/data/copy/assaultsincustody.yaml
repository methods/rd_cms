              - The data provides the number of prisoner involvements in assaults in the capacity of Assailant, Fighter or Victim, by ethnic group (5+1) in each calendar year from 2000 to 2015.
              - These three categories reflect the way prison officers record incidents of assault. When an attacker and a victim can be identified clearly, they will be recorded as assailant and victim. When the altercation was mutual, the prisoners involved will be recorded as fighters.
              - Separately, also presented are the prisoner involvements in assaults as Assailant, Fighter or Victim as a rate per 1,000 prisoners across the 12 month period, by calendar year in each year from 2011 to 2015 by ethnic group (5+1). This is more useful information for comparisons, so is the principal focus of the following information.
              - Assaults in prison custody cover a wide range of violent incidents, including fights between prisoners. NOMS does not use the Home Office counting rule definitions of Actual Bodily Harm (ABH), Grievous Bodily Harm (GBH), affray etc. and figures cannot be compared directly.

            content: 
              - The data provides information on the ethnicity of assailants, fighters and victims involved in prison assaults. This comprises of prisoners involved in each individual assault incident, meaning that individual prisoners can be included in the data more than once. As there may be more than one assailant and/or fighter and/or victim per assault, as well as the fact that in instances where assaults involve a fight, there are always at least two, the data provides a very general overview of the topic.
              - This also means that rate per 1,000 prisoners should be considered with some caution, as prisoners can be counted more than once in the data. In addition, an informative analysis of ethnicity in relation to assaults may want to consider whether an assault incident or a fight involved people of the same or different ethnicities. However data to facilitate such analysis is not readily available. Ethnicity breakdowns of assaults data therefore present only a straightforward breakdown of the ethnicity of assailants, fighters and victims.
              - These figures only include prisoner involvements. A considerable number of assault incidents are assaults on staff.  None of these victims are included here, as details of individual staff involved are not recorded centrally. Assaults can also involve other non-prisoner groups (e.g. visitors), none of whom are included within these figures.
              - To calculate the prisoner population typically, a 12-month average is used where this data was accessible. As this data was not accessible for the prisoner population by age or by ethnicity, quarterly data was used to calculate the prisoner population.
              - Race is based on self-reporting by prisoners and has not been independently validated. It is based on recorded ethnicity within the prison administrative system.
              - These figures have been drawn from the NOMS Incident Reporting System. Care is taken when processing and analysing the returns but the detail collected is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large-scale recording system, and so although shown to the last case, the figures may not be accurate to that level.

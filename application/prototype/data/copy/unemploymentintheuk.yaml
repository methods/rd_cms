      - between 2014 and 2015, we estimate that 5% of the UK’s total potential workforce were unemployed
      - black people were 3 times more likely to be unemployed than White people
      - overall, more men than women were unemployed
      - young people aged 16 to 24 had the highest unemployment rate
      - the group with the lowest rate of unemployment were White people over 50
      - since 2002, the rate of unemployment in the UK has fallen for all ethnic groups

              - This data shows the rate of UK unemployment as a percentage of the total number of people who could potentially be working.
              - We define the unemployed as people without a job who have been actively seeking work in the past 4 weeks. They also need to be available to start work in the next 2 weeks. The unemployed figure also includes people who are out of work, but have found a job and will start it in the next 2 weeks. 
              - The level and rate of UK unemployment are measured by the <a href='https://www.ons.gov.uk/surveys/informationforhouseholdsandindividuals/householdandindividualsurveys/labourforcesurveylfs'>Labour Force Survey</a> (LFS), using a definition of unemployment from the <a href='http://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm'>International Labour Organisation</a>.

            - These unemployment figures are estimates based on a national survey and therefore are subject to sampling error and in some cases may not reflect the actual population.
            - Smaller numbers of survey respondents from ethnic minority backgrounds mean that unemployment estimates for ethnic minorities are more unreliable than estimates for White people.
            - Results derived from a low number of responses are more likely to be affected by statistical variation, so observed changes might not reflect real differences. As such, caution is needed when interpreting short-term trends in the data especially for sub groups (for example, a particular ethnic group, age group and gender). Any values based on fewer than five responses have been completely suppressed. Values based on 5-10 responses are shown, but marked by an asterisk (*). These should be used with particular caution.
            - Estimates for unemployment rates by ethnicity by age by gender are given as annual estimates rather than quarterly estimates as sample sizes are not large enough to give reliable quarterly estimates.
            - Changes were made to the Labour Force Survey ethnicity questions in January to March 2011 to bring them more in line with Census data collection on these topics. In April to June 2011 furthers changes were made to the ethnicity questions to bring them in line with Scottish Census. As a result there may be some inconsistencies with estimates prior to 2011.

        title: How the data is measured
        _copy: 
          - Unemployment figures are survey based. Smaller numbers of respondents from ethnic minority backgrounds mean that unemployment estimates for ethnic minorities are more volatile than estimates for white people.
      -
        title: Methodology
        _copy: 
          - The data shows figures for the labour market status of people aged 16 and over, covering annual averages between 1993 and 2015 (excluding 2001). The data is all drawn from the Labour Force Survey and broken down by ethnic group, as reported by survey respondents. All data is for Great Britain and has not been seasonally adjusted.
          - Results derived from a low number of responses are more likely to be affected by statistical variation, so observed changes might not reflect real differences. As such, caution is needed when interpreting short-term trends in the data especially for sub groups (for example, a particular ethnicity, age group and gender). Any values based on fewer than five responses have been completely suppressed. Values based on 5- 10 responses are shown, but marked by an asterisk (*). These should be used with particular caution.

        title: Sample size
        _copy: 
          - The LFS is a UK household sample survey which collects information from approximately 45,000 households each quarter. Since those responses reflect only a sample (around 1 in 650) of the total population, they are weighted (scaled-up) on the basis of subnational population totals by age and sex to give estimates for the entire UK household population.
          - "New population estimates based on the 2011 Census of Population were used by the Office for National Statistics to produce updated LFS data and labour market statistics. These re-weighted figures were available from October 2014 and were published in the Labour Market Status by Ethnic Group series in December 2014. More information on re-weighting can be found at the following link:"

          - We suppress some figures. Some additional figures have been suppressed to prevent the possibility of a suppressed figure being revealed. This suppression is consistent with our Statistical policy statement on confidentiality.

        title: Estimation
        _copy: 
          - We round numbers. Percentages are given to 1 decimal place but all gaps and differences have been calculated on unrounded data. Therefore some figures may not match those produced from the rounded figures shown in the tables. All numbers are rounded to nearest 10,000 and may not sum due to rounding.

        title: Employed
        _copy: 
          - These are people who are in paid work (as an employee or selfemployed), those who have a job that they are temporarily away from, some participants on government-supported training and employment programmes and those doing unpaid family work. Employed people are classed as economically active.
      -
        title: ILO unemployed
        _copy: 
          - These are people who are jobless, have been actively seeking work in the past four weeks and are available to start work in the next two weeks; or are out of work, but have found a job and are waiting to start it in the next two weeks. This definition of unemployment is the one laid down by the International Labour Organisation and is used in regular published UK statistics. Unemployed people are classed as economically active.
      -
        title: Economically inactive
        _copy: 
          - These are people without a job who have not actively sought work in the last four weeks and/or are not available to start working in the next two weeks. Someone in full-time education will normally be classified as economically inactive if they are not in paid work, but if they are looking for and are available for work then they will be classified as unemployed and hence economically active.

          - FTE is defined as those who are either (1) at school (fulltime), (2) on a sandwich course or (3) in full time university or college education.

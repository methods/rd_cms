      <li>who our users are</li>
      <li>how the project was developed</li>

    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"
        id="understanding-users">Understanding users</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">To be sure the project would provide value, hundreds of users have been interviewed or
      involved in user research since the start. It was important to understand who our users are, their different needs
      and how they might already be met elsewhere, and which of their problems could be solved by Ethnicity facts and
      figures.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The groups of users included:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>members of the public from diverse backgrounds and ethnicities</li>
      <li>government policy officials and analysts</li>
      <li>non-government organisations</li>
      <li>academics</li>
      <li>public service managers (for example, headteachers and Jobcentre managers)</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">Users came from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, locations and demographic profiles to reflect
      the diversity of the website’s user base.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The needs of users vary a great deal, as does their understanding of statistical data. For
      this reason, the content of the website had to be clear and meaningful for people who are not experts in
      statistics and data. The website also had to be accessible, so that people with impairments or disabilities could
      use the service. Users with more expertise in statistics needed access to the raw data itself and more detailed
      background information about how it was collected and analysed.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Trust was an important factor across the different user groups. They all wanted to feel
      confident that the information on the website was reliable and impartial, and presented in a way that was of value
      to the public.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"
        id="principles-and-good-practice">Principles and good practice</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">There are well-established principles, standards and practices for working on data and
      statistics, and for delivering digital services. These helped the team produce work of a high quality that could
      be trusted and understood by users.</p>

      public use.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"
        id="consultation-and-engagement">Consultation and engagement</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">In order to benefit from good practice, expertise and rigorous public consultation and
      testing, the project has engaged users and stakeholders in co-designing the programme.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">For example, we used the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)’s measurement framework
      as a reference point for the structure of the website.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The EHRC framework monitors progress on equality and human rights in England, Scotland and
      Wales and is organised into broad subject areas, or ‘domains’, indicators and measures of equality.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The website framework has a similar structure in the form of topics, sub-topics and data
      pages:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>important aspects of life in the UK like health, education and housing are organised into topics</li>
      <li>sub-topics group together similar subject areas within a topic – for example, patient experiences and patient
        outcomes under health</li>
      <li>measures capture specific facts and figures relating to a subject area – for example, GP services, dental
        services and hospital care under patient experiences</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">This structure has been thoroughly tested to check that users can easily find the content they
      are looking for.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"
        id="project-phases">Project phases</h2>
    <div class="eff-numbered-sections">
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s eff-numbered-sections__item">Identifiying information</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">The initial review asked all government departments to identify what information on
        ethnicity they had on important aspects of life in the UK. Devolved administrations were asked to participate
        and share their data.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Local authority data is not included unless it is also available from a central department –
        for example, the Department for Education provides school data in England at a local level.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Data from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is included in areas that are not devolved –
        for example, the Home Office reports on victims of crime across the UK.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s eff-numbered-sections__item">Prioritising the work</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">During this initial review, government departments identified a lot of data which it was not
        possible to collect and publish in the time we had available.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">In consultation with the departments and drawing on user research, we agreed a set of
        criteria to shorten the list for the first release. The agreed prioritisation criteria were:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>does the dataset relate to a government priority?</li>
        <li>has it been identified by future users of the website as a priority for them?</li>
        <li>how much work is involved in preparing the data for publication?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s eff-numbered-sections__item">Collecting the data</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">A format for collecting content from departments was established based on Cabinet Office
        research, data expertise.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The data varies greatly in size, consistency and quality. There is limited standardisation,
        and classification of different ethnicities can differ widely depending on how and when data was collected. A
        common format was needed to ensure trust, quality and value across the content presented on the website. Each
        data page contains 2 file templates:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a data format file, used to populate charts and tables</li>
        <li>commentary, which explains the facts and figures shown and gives technical details on how the data was
          collected</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">The data pages went through additional checks to ensure their quality and consistency,
        before being uploaded to the site.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s eff-numbered-sections__item govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">Publishing</h3>

      </h1>

      <p class="govuk-body">In England and Wales, there are 18 ethnic groups recommended for use by government when they ask for someone’s ethnicity. These are grouped into 5 broad ethnic groups, each with an ‘Any other’ option where respondents can write in their ethnicity using their own words.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The recommended ethnic groups are:</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-bottom-1">White</h2>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>English / Welsh / Scottish / Northern Irish / British</li>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-bottom-1">Mixed / Multiple ethnic groups</h2>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

      <p class="govuk-body">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) runs the Census of England and Wales every 10 years. They decide which ethnic groups to include in consultation with:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>users of Census data (like government departments, local authorities, and the National Health Service)</li>
          <li>people completing the Census, and the interest groups that represent them</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">It is recognised that these ethnic groups do not represent how all people identify. People are encouraged to write in their ethnicity using their own words if they don’t identify with any groups in the list. </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">There has been an ethnicity question in the Census since 1991. It has been updated at every new Census since then. There are separate questions in the Census about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/ethnicity/articles/ethnicityandnationalidentityinenglandandwales/2012-12-11#national-identity-in-england-and-wales">national identity</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/religion">religion</a>.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">A single, standardised list makes it easier to analyse ethnicity data wherever it is collected.</p>

          <li>they need data on some ethnic groups, but not others</li>
          <li>they want their data to be consistent with data they’ve collected previously, which uses different ethnic groups</li>
          <li>the low number of people surveyed in some ethnic groups means data has to be combined to make it more reliable, or to protect individual identities</li>

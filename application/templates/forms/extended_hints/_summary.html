        <li>overall, the figures for fear of crime have remained consistent between 2013/14 and 2015/16</li>
        <li>in 2015/16, a smaller proportion of White people reported a fear of crime compared with Asian people, Black people, and those from the Other ethnic group</li>
        <li>pupils from the Traveller of Irish Heritage and Gypsy/Roma ethnic groups had the highest ‘overall absence’ rates (rates of school sessions missed due to authorised and unauthorised absences) and ‘persistent absence’ rates (pupils missing 10% or more of their school sessions)</li>
        <li>for other ethnic groups, too few adults responded to the survey or the responses were too varied to draw firm conclusions</li>
